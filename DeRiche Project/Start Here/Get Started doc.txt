Get Started

To get started with working on the application you can either download and install Netbeans 8.1 IDE, Java 1.8 SDK, and 
MySQL Workbench. It is up to your group if you want to continue using what we used over the Fall Semester or something
different. When you first run the program it will notify you that you are missing some files. All you have to do is click
Resolve and find the proper file in the Resources folder.
